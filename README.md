# Task Overview
You are handling a FastAPI backend API that has recently enforced JWT-based authentication on its '/users' endpoints. However, all requests to these endpoints, even with valid tokens, result in 401 Unauthorized errors. The root cause relates to improper JWT authentication dependency usage or misintegration in the router. Your objective is to find and resolve this core issue, restoring proper secure access for authenticated users while keeping public endpoints open.

# Guidance
- Focus on the authentication flow concerning JWT Bearer tokens and their validation.
- Review the router setup and how dependencies are declared for the '/users' endpoints.
- Distinguish between authentication requirements for protected and public routes.
- Validate that the authentication dependency is applied and functioning as intended.
- Ensure no changes are made that would expose protected endpoints to unauthorized access.

# Objectives
- Diagnose and fix the authentication failure that affects all '/users' endpoints.
- Ensure '/users' endpoints only allow requests with valid Bearer JWT tokens.
- Keep public (non-authenticated) endpoints open to all users, regardless of authentication.
- Restore the correct authentication logic using a concise and production-appropriate approach.

# How to Verify
- Confirm that authenticated requests with valid JWT tokens can access all '/users' endpoints successfully.
- Confirm that requests without tokens, or with invalid/expired tokens, to '/users' endpoints return 401 errors.
- Confirm that public endpoints remain accessible to all users, regardless of authentication status.
